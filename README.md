 CRUSTDE-Containerized-Rust-Dev-Env is a "GitHub organization" that groups [multiple repositories](https://github.com/orgs/CRUSTDE-Containerized-Rust-Dev-Env/repositories?q=sort%3Aname-asc) together.

## Install and config Windows and programs needed for Rust development

Often we must reinstall windows from scratch to solve some unsolvable problems.  
Thanks, Microsoft!  
This is a good exercise. We must learn how to save settings for different programs.  
This is a very opinionated guide to creating a development environment from scratch:

## Total Commander - the best file manager for Windows

I make acrobatics with files all day long. I could not live without TotalCommander.

## Windows: Git, git-bash, SSH and VSCode

These Windows utils I use for CRUSTDE: git, git-bash, SSH, VSCode.

## Win10 contains WSL2 that contains Debian11

Tutorial to install Linux on Windows. Linux everywhere!  
I chose Debian because it is stable, but probably everything works in other flavors too.

Tutorial for creating and using CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment.  
Rust - Hack Without Fear and Trust!  
I regularly create new container images when new versions of cargo and rustc are released.  
The container images are published to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bestiadev).

## Cross compile in CRUSTDE Rust Container

Cross-compile Rust to Linux, Windows, Musl container, WASI and WASM with CRUSTDE container
